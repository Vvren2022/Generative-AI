Generative AI Overview: Exploring Vector Databases, LangChain, OpenAI Models, Llama Models, and More
Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can generate new content, such as text, images, music, or even code, based on input data. These models are often based on deep learning architectures, particularly transformers, and are widely used in tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and more.

To effectively harness the power of generative AI, tools like vector databases, LangChain, and models from organizations like OpenAI and Meta's Llama models play a crucial role. Let's explore each of these technologies:
